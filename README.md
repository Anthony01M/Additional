## Please read it fully to understand how this works.

With the new method that was found, I("Anthony") was able to detect versions, config & language changes through the following system that I've established in my plugin.
Of course, it will be hard for new people that recently manage MC Servers to understand such or even, those whom are still learning.
This is not a good or that well method but instead classed as poor but yet, managable enough to handle all the requests.

### Versions
Up on checking and even experimenting the situation, I felt the cause of adding an update notifier, allowing people to be able to check the current updates & see if there's any new updates, relaxable isn't it? To what I added, I was able to config how my system works in easy and a moderated solution allowing such to be an acceptable system rather than use SpigotMC, etc.

### Config & Language File
I felt, not only bored and the need of doing it, an urgent need of doing such allowing me to quickly check & make config rather outside of the plugin ( which is stupid but for me, it helps everyone out so it's good ) thus allowing people to check the whole config file, language file & see how they look.
